# Tim-Oliver.com Site Theme (2008-2013)
#### The WordPress theme for my blog for 5 years!

## What is this?

This is the theme I originally built for my blog when I launcehd it in 2008. As of 2013, since the landscape of 
the web has changed significantly in that time, I felt this theme had started to show its age a bit. As of creating a new
theme for my blog, I've now made all of the code for this theme available on my GitHub account.

## License

As this blog theme was originally built upon the base WordPress theme, it is licensed under the GPL license.
